Biology Wednesday brought a deep dive into the diversity of life and the human body, all through art and play. We began with a hands-on evolution simulation that let kids experience natural selection firsthand. Using “beaks” (chopsticks, spoons, and forks), they tried to “eat” pieces of macaroni. Some tools were better suited for certain pasta shapes, just like real birds with different beaks. Campers soon realized that small changes can give species advantages, and how those changes play a role in evolution.<br /><br />
Next, we shifted to a creative activity where campers traced outlines of a body on large sheets of paper, and filled them in with organs and body systems using markers. With each drawing, they learned how everything in our bodies is connected, and how everything works together to help us function.<br /><br />
The final activity of the day was definitely the most delicious: building candy neurons. Using Twizzlers as axons, Jolly Ranchers as nuclei, and Mike and Ikes as dendrites, students built candy replicas of the components that power our brains. As they assembled their edible neurons, they learned how messages are sent throughout the body. We discussed the parts of a neuron, how electrical signals work, and what happens when different parts of the brain are activated. Then, of course, campers got to eat their unique diagrams, bringing a sweet end to a fun day of biology.<br /><br />
