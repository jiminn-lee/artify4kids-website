Our recently concluded week-long summer camp was an exhilarating journey of creativity for our young artists! Held from July 29th to August 2nd, the camp offered days full of various activities, projects, and workshops for children to enjoy, bringing kids of all ages together.<br /><br />
With each day focusing on a unique project, no student was left not entertained or disinterested! Each session introduced new techniques, mediums, and materials, encouraging all children to explore new art forms and express their creativity in new ways. While creating unique tiger collages, shoebox dioramas of different environments, and watercolor jellyfish, kids and volunteers alike learned about the nature that surrounds us in our everyday lives. Similarly, painting their own recreations of Monet’s famous garden taught them interesting aspects of art history and popular art pieces. On the last day of camp, everyone had a blast as we enjoyed a delicious ice-cream party to kick off the end of a very successful program!<br /><br />
Though this was our very first year of Artify’s very own summer camp, it was a resounding success! The creativity and enthusiasm shown by all our participants is truly inspiring. One volunteer, Katherine Yu, had a particularly illuminating experience with Artify, stating, “The positivity and dedication of the volunteers working alongside me inspired me to become a long term member of their team, volunteering throughout the year and helping them achieve their goal of aiding underserved children.” Thanks to our dedicated volunteers, members, parents, and young artists, we feel especially connected to our community and are further motivated to continue spreading our mission!<br /><br />
