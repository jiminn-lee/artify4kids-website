Recently, Artify had the pleasure of revisiting John Muir Elementary School for another exciting art event! Last year, when Artify was just starting, our visit to the school truly reestablished our mission of making art accessible and exciting for young kids. We were blown away by the talent and creativity of the students then, and this year, they didn’t disappoint!<br /><br />

This time,we brought one of our favorite activities: bubble art! Kids used straws to blow bubbles into watered-down paint, and gently pressed their paper onto the bubbles, creating vibrant and abstract prints. The joy on their faces was truly priceless to see, as each student created a unique design everyone was proud of. The kids, parents, and volunteers alike had a blast seeing the various creations we could make, as well as interacting with one another. One volunteer, Natalie Tan, shared something about her experience that many of us agree with: “.. to see how happy the kids were when they were able to do a fun project for free, and just seeing them made me enjoy that experience that much more.”<br /><br />

It was amazing to see how much Artify has grown since our first visit. We’ve developed new programs, expanded our reach, and learned so much along the way. Despite all this change, our dedication to empowering young artists through art has remained constant. Being able to return to John Muir Elementary was a full-circle moment, reminding us of why we started this journey in the first place. We hope to continue building strong connections with our community and inspiring future generations of artists. We’re excited about what the future holds, and can’t wait to return next year!
