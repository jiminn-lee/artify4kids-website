Thursday’s focus was all about our planet and its systems. Campers explored Earth science through tactile art projects and interactive games that taught them about geology and earth systems.<br /><br />
We kicked things off by making 3D Earth models with Model Magic. Each camper crafted and colored their own model to show the core, mantle, crust,. With labels and unique drawings of components of each layer, they proudly presented their Earth replicas, which helped them visualize the entire planet.<br /><br />
Next, we transitioned to a more artistic project with watercolor experiments. Using watercolor paint, salt, and brushes, campers created vivid landscapes and drawings. When salt was sprinkled over wet paint, it interacted with the water and left behind fascinating crystalline patterns and textures that added a unique touch to each young artist’s work.<br /><br />
Later in the day, campers learned about both the rock cycle and water cycle using diagrams and hands-on edible models made from Starburst candy. Through this, they learned about how rocks are formed and how water cycles through the planet. At the end, during free draw and facepainting time, they had a blast watching The Magic School Bus and recognizing what they had learned earlier in each episode.<br /><br />
