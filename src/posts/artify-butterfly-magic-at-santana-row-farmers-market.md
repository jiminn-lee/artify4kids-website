On Wednesday, Artify had another opportunity to light up Santana Row with a vibrant and entertaining arts and crafts booth for children! In the center of the bustling shopping center, our station quickly became a popular spot for families of young artists, providing an exciting area of creative fun. The day’s highlight was our butterfly-making project, designed to inspire creativity even with seemingly ordinary materials: markers and coffee filters.<br /><br />
Children started by decorating the coffee filters, an extensive variety of colored markers at their disposal. With full creative freedom, the kids had the opportunity to explore different colors, patterns, and techniques to create unique designs. After decorating, the filters were lightly misted with water. Though a minor step, it allowed the colors to spread and merge, creating aesthetic, watercolor-like effects that seemed like magic before our eyes! Once the filters dried, the kids shaped them into butterfly wings and attached pipe cleaners for antenna and bodies. The result was an array of colorful, handcrafted butterflies unique to each artist.<br /><br />

The event was an incredible opportunity to not only spread our mission promoting art education, but also connect with our community. Our volunteers and members had a blast interacting with the young artists and their families while indulging in their own artistic fantasies. The atmosphere and creativity was truly inspiring!<br /><br />
