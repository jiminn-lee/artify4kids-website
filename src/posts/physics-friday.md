Camp Imagineers came to a close with Physics Friday, which was all about motion, light, and energy. We started with an exciting rocket launch and catapult challenge. Using cups, sticks, tape, and creative thinking, students designed their own mini rockets to launch across the room. We talked about Newtonâ€™s Laws of Motion, which they took into consideration when creating their rocket models. With each launch, campers watched as their rockets soared higher and farther depending on their design. They had a great time testing different design ideas to see how they could change where their rocket goes, which of course introduced a competition among all the groups.<br /><br />
Later in the day, campers took on the project of building their own kaleidoscopes. Using paper, beads, and cardboard tubes, they created unique devices that demonstrated how light reflects and refracts to create repeated patterns. When using their kaleidoscopes, they seemed to be mesmerized by the shifting patterns and seemingly infinite colors.<br /><br />
By the end of the day, campers had explored various principles of physics, and put them into play with their own rockets and kaleidoscopes. It was the perfect end to a week filled with new STEAM discoveries and endless energy!<br /><br />
